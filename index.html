        <p>Only now is the paintwork ready for machine polishing. Using an electrical machine polisher, we start with the finest grade of polish, gradually working up to coarser grades of polish as required to achieve a good level of correction. Then we work back down to the finest grade of polish to refine the paints finish. At all stages the cars trim adjacent to the area being worked on will be masked carefully to avoid damage.</p>

<p>Now we carry out a fully body wipe down with IPA to remove any residue from the polish, leaving your paint perfectly clean ready for the first stage in the waxing process.</p>
