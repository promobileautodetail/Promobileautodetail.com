Then we work back down to the finest grade of polish to refine the paints finish. At all stages the cars trim adjacent to the area being worked on will be masked carefully to avoid damage.\r\n\r\nNow we carry out a fully body wipe down with IPA to remove any residue from the polish, leaving your paint perfectly clean ready for the first stage in the waxing process.\r\n\r\nVisit our company website:- [http://www.promobileautodetail.com/](http://www.promobileautodetail.com/)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
